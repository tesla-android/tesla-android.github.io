### About

We all know that Tesla vehicles are not designed to support Android, CarPlay or Android Auto. This project changes that by turning the browser into an interactive Android tablet that works when the vehicle is being driven. 

After six months of work first alpha version has been released. The main objective for this release has been simple: usability. For the project to scale and become popular in the Tesla community it needs to provide a responsive Android experience. Otherwise, people won't use it.

September 2022 marks another huge milestone for the project - version 2022.38.1 drops the two board requirement. All the essential software required has been migrated to run in the AOSP(Android Open Source Project) ecosystem. Several other bugs have been fixed as well. 
Hardware simplification helps in reducing both cost and entry barrier for less technical users. 

October 2022 release dropped the capture card requirement. A single Raspberry Pi is all you need to get Android in your Tesla. This version introduces a new single system image that can be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi easily like any other operating system. 

January 2023, version 2023.4.1 was released. One year after the development of Tesla Android started, the project received one of its most significant updates. Android 13, a new audio module with DRM support, hardware-accelerated H264 video decoding and encoding, support for USB tethering for Android devices, and a lot of other improvements make Tesla Android close to being feature-complete.

May 2023 version(2023.18.1) brought OTA updates and hardware acceleration to the virtual display component.

GPS and responsive virtual display has been added in August 2023(2023.32.1).
