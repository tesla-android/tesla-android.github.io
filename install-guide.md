## Install guide (2023.20.0)

#### Over-the-air updates

OTA updates are supported on versions newer than 2023.18. <br>
To check for updates navigate to Settings->System->Updater.

#### Notes

1) **Make sure to clear the Tesla Browser cache** before connecting to a new version of Tesla Android's web page at ``app.teslaandroid.com``. This ensures the proper web app is used at all times. It the web page does not work for you please try ``100.64.255.1``

2) **Raspberry Pi firmware update might be needed** before installing Tesla Android. Verions 2023.18.1 & newer require that the Raspberry Pi firmware is 2022-04-26 or newer. The updated bootloader is available in Raspberry Pi Imager.<br>


### Setup steps

1. Begin by downloading the newest build of Tesla Android from GitHub - [Raspberry Pi 4 releases](https://github.com/tesla-android/android-raspberry-pi/releases). 
2. Using Raspberry Pi Imager flash an image named: "TeslaAndroid-XXXX-rpi4-single-image-installer.img.zip" to your SD Card.
3. Grab yourself something to drink, it will take a while.
4. Insert the SD Card into your Raspberry Pi 4 and power it on.
5. Grab yourself something to drink, it will take a while.
6. After booting into Android your Pi will start broadcasting it's own Wi-Fi network. The default password is ``changeit``. You can update it anytime using Android system settings.
7. You did it, you have successfully installed Android 13 on a Raspberry Pi 4!

You've done it. Deploy it in your Tesla, it's ready :) Place the hardware somewhere near the center console, power using USB ports or a external 12V power supply. After connecting your car to the Wi-Fi make sure to check the: "Remain connected in Drive" checkbox in your Tesla. The URL for the Tesla Android frontend is: ``app.teslaandroid.com``.

### Optional steps

#### Google Play Store

Since Raspberry Pi 4 is not a certified Android device some apps might not be available in the Play Store. You can install them manually using sites like APK Mirror.

#### Audio output

Audio from Android is routed directly to your Tesla Browser.

Playback is allowed even when Drive or Reverse is engaged, meaning that there is no need to pair Tesla Android with your car using Bluetooth(Bluetooth link with the car is only used by your phone for Android Auto or CarPlay).

Audio output from Tesla Browser does not pause media playback from Tesla OS or CarPlay.

#### CarPlay

Tesla Android comes with an app called AutoKit. It enables Apple CarPlay or Android auto using a dongle from Carlinkit (required for both wireless and wired modes). To ensure it works properly apply recommended configuration:
- In Advanced Settings section change Audio Channel(Beta) to Bluetooth (That is very important, this option makes it possible to connect your phone directly to the Car. This enables microphone, steering wheel controls, Siri etc).

### Extras

#### Offline mode

Starting with version 2022.27.1 the LTE modem is not required for Tesla Android to maintain connection with your car.<br>
Keep in mind that certain online features might not be available in your car as it expects the Wi-Fi network to replace the connectivity provided by Tesla.<br>
When using the Offline Mode turning off Wi-Fi on your touchscreen or powering off Tesla Android is required for accessing your car with the Tesla Mobile App while parked.<br>
Tesla Android can still be used to provide internet to your car like in previous build - no extra configuration changes are required.

** Version 2023.20.1 includes an updated offline mode. Your Tesla will not send Telemetry data to Tesla and the firmware updates will not download using the Tesla Android Wi-Fi network. The ability to check if your car runs the latest Tesla firmware is not affected. **

#### Wi-Fi performance

Version 2023.20.1 add support for 5GHz Wi-Fi. The new future can be manually enabled in Settings and should improve the network speed significantly. **If you switch to 5GHz Wi-Fi for Tesla Android please consider changing the CarPlay dongle operation mode to 2.4GHz in order to avoid interference.** 5GHz Wi-Fi might not support all regions due to regional restrictions, please report any potential issues.
